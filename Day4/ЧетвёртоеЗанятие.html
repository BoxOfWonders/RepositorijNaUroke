	<div class="Block1">Demi-lancer was a term used in 16th century military parlance, especially in England, to <sub>designate cavalrymen mounted</sub> on unarmoured horses, armed with a slightly <sup>lighter version of the heavy lance</sup> of a man-at-arms and wearing three-quarter or half-armour, as opposed to the full plate armour of the knight or gendarme. The breastplate and shoulder defences of the demi-lancer were intended to be at least pistol proof. <mark>Often an open faced helmet</mark>, such as the burgonet, was worn in place of the fully enclosing close helm. <span class="cursive">The armour for the </span> leg was replaced by long, cuff-topped, riding boots. In addition to the lance the demi-lancer would have been armed with one or two pistols, housed in saddle holsters, and a sword. Demi-lancers were representative of the early modern trend of <i class="weight"> reducing the coverage of armour </i> while increasing its thickness to provide protection for the vital areas against the fire of gunpowder-based firearms of the time, such as the caliver, arquebus and, later, the musket. This abbreviated armour was also meant to increase the mobility of the men and horses, <strong><em>as well as reducing the expense inherent in equipping and maintaining them throughout a long campaign.</em></strong>In common with other 16th-century cavalrymen, the demi-lancers were frequently used to strike the enemy's flank and to chase down routing troops.</div>
